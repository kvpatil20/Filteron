### Filtron: Chrome Extension for a quick review of an item on Amazon website.   

#### How it works:
```
 - Popping colors, like yellow and cyan are used to hight positive and negative reviews respectively. 
 - With the calculated amount of positive and negative comments, document title is changed accordingly to 
   "Great Product!" or "Bad Reviews". 
 - An icon on the browser of the extension will also help us to determine the color key, so as to avoid color 
   confusion.
```

#### Accomplishments: 
```
Observed that customer's comments contradicts their ratings. Thus, segregated the positive and negative 
comments based on the reviews they post. 
Succesfully learned how to make Chrome Extensions and dynamically alter the webpage.
